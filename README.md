# Otaku Center

## Description

This project is for those who enjoy Japanese anime, and would like a space where they can discover more shows to watch and participate in a community discussion.

## Usage

A User signs up for an account on the website using their own username and password, which creates a record on our backend database. That information is saved in our sesssions, and a user is then logged in where they will be able to view features that are unavailable unless logged in. Users can navigate to the Animes page, where they will see a list of anime that is being fetched from our backend database managed with Ruby on Rails. When an anime is clicked, a page loads with an array of information about each anime, such as their creater, studio, and a summary. Reviews of the anime is also amoung the information being shown. Here users can create different reviews. Users can also delete and edit a review, but only the one they created. Users may also favorite a anime for their own personal collection of animes that they can find should they navigate to the favorites page.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

## Roadmap 
For future updates on this application, an additional model added representing different studios that develop anime. This will allow the user to filer suggested anime, based on what studio they came from. A user will have more customization such as an avatar, as well as being able to change their password at will. A discussion board will be integrated that will allow users to communicate on different threads of conversation, besides the feedback read from reviews left on anime. Favorited anime will be able to be removed should a user choose to. Furthermore, a star rating system will replace the current scoring system, and after that an average of ratings will be added together and averaged out.
